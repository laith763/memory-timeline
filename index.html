                I remember how we were both so shy, stealing glances and nervous
                smiles. Those quiet moments of uncertainty made everything feel
                more precious, more real.

                Do you remember when we made tea on the fire under the stars?
                The warmth of the flames dancing in your eyes, the sweet aroma
                filling the cool night air, and the way time seemed to stand
                still as we sat together in perfect silence. Those simple
                moments with you are the ones I treasure most.

        <h2>Happy Birthday 🎂</h2>
        <p>You are my favorite story.</p>
        <p class="soulmate-message">
          Finding a soulmate isn't just about discovering someone who completes
          you—it's about finding the person who inspires you to become the best
          version of yourself. It's in the quiet moments of understanding, the
          shared laughter that needs no explanation, and the comfort of knowing
          that no matter what life brings, you'll face it together. A soulmate
          is the one who sees your flaws and loves you anyway, who celebrates
          your victories as their own, and who turns ordinary days into
          extraordinary memories. You are that person for me, my soulmate, my
          best friend, and my forever.
